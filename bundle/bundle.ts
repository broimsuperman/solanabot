// Work in progress!

//Steps
// Use Master Wallet (defined in .env)
// Get the amount of wallets we want to create
// get the amount of solana we want to distribute in total
// create new wallets 
// transfer sol to each wallet
// determine if using bundling after master wallet buys
// or if all at the same time
// get the stop loss and take profit
// when close, bot will sell twice and create 2 or 4 more buys
// if safe bundling is enabled
// once a break even has been established,
// the bot will sell all at once
// bots will transfer to master wallet or burn wallet
// bot workers will destruct, but save private keys into a file
// if something goes wrong, add an option to drain workers wallets into master wallet
